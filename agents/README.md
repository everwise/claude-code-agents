# Claude Code Agents - Technical Reference

Comprehensive documentation for specialized Claude Code agents with detailed capabilities, usage patterns, and orchestration workflows.

## Agent Architecture Overview

### Orchestrational vs Specialized Agents

**Orchestrational Agents** coordinate complex workflows by delegating to multiple specialized agents:
- Handle end-to-end processes
- Make strategic decisions about which specialized agents to use
- Manage multi-step workflows with quality gates
- Examples: `feature-architect`, `jira-workitem-implementer`, `pr-review-comment-resolver`

**Specialized Agents** provide focused expertise in specific domains:
- Single responsibility, deep expertise
- Called by orchestrational agents or used directly for targeted tasks
- Examples: `debugger`, `code-quality-reviewer`, `tdd-test-writer`

## Orchestrational Agents

These agents coordinate complex workflows and delegate to specialized agents:

## Orchestration Patterns

### Key Delegation Workflows

**`jira-workitem-implementer` workflow**:
```
1. jira-workitem-analyzer â†’ Parse ticket requirements
2. feature-architect â†’ Complex planning & architecture  
3. tdd-test-writer â†’ Test creation
4. iterative-quality-fixer â†’ Quality enforcement
5. debugger + code-quality-reviewer â†’ Issue resolution
```

**`iterative-quality-fixer` workflow**:
```
1. debugger â†’ Analyze failures and errors
2. code-quality-reviewer â†’ Quality assessment  
3. Iterative fix-test-verify cycles until success
```

**`pr-review-comment-resolver` workflow**:
```
1. Fetch and categorize PR review comments
2. iterative-quality-fixer â†’ Systematic comment resolution
3. Quality verification and PR cleanup
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Proactive Agent Usage
These agents should be used proactively without explicit user requests:
- **`debugger`**: When encountering any errors or issues
- **`code-quality-reviewer`**: After writing significant code
- **`iterative-quality-fixer`**: For systematic quality improvements
- **`pr-review-comment-resolver`**: When PR has review comments
- **`information-consolidator`**: For scattered or redundant content
- **`jira-workitem-analyzer`**: When working with Jira tickets
- **`code-comment-reviewer`**: During code reviews or refactoring

### Agent Selection Strategy

**For Complex Development Tasks**:
- **New features/complex bugs**: Start with `feature-architect`
- **Jira ticket implementation**: Use `jira-workitem-implementer` for end-to-end automation
- **Quality issues**: Use `iterative-quality-fixer` for systematic resolution

**For Code Quality & Review**:
- **Production readiness**: Use `code-quality-reviewer` for uncompromising assessment
- **PR feedback resolution**: Use `pr-review-comment-resolver` for systematic addressing
- **Test coverage**: Start with `tdd-test-writer` before implementation

**For Troubleshooting & Maintenance**:
- **Errors/failures**: Use `debugger` for systematic troubleshooting
- **Outdated comments**: Use `pr-comment-validator` for cleanup
- **Documentation**: Use `information-consolidator` for organization

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Workflow Orchestration Examples

**Complex Feature Development**:
```bash
# 1. Start with architecture planning
feature-architect "implement user authentication system"

# 2. Test-driven approach
tdd-test-writer "write tests for authentication flow"  

# 3. Quality enforcement during development
iterative-quality-fixer "ensure all tests pass and code quality gates"
```

**Jira Ticket Resolution**:
```bash
# Single command for complete implementation
jira-workitem-implementer "APL-1234"

# Or step-by-step approach
jira-workitem-analyzer "APL-1234"
feature-architect "implement requirements from analysis"
```

**PR Review Workflow**:
```bash
# Address all review comments systematically
pr-review-comment-resolver "PR #123"

# Clean up outdated comments after changes
pr-comment-validator "PR #123"
```

### Agent Combination Strategies

**High-Quality Development**:
1. `tdd-test-writer` â†’ Write tests first
2. `feature-architect` â†’ Plan implementation  
3. `code-quality-reviewer` â†’ Review code quality
4. `iterative-quality-fixer` â†’ Fix any issues

**Emergency Bug Fix**:
1. `debugger` â†’ Identify root cause
2. `tdd-test-writer` â†’ Add regression tests
3. `iterative-quality-fixer` â†’ Ensure fix is complete

- **Read-Only**: Analysis agents with limited modification capabilities

## Development Guidelines

### Creating New Agents
1. **Define clear scope**: Single responsibility or orchestrational coordination
2. **Specify tool requirements**: Minimal necessary tool set
3. **Document delegation patterns**: If orchestrational, specify which agents to call
4. **Provide usage examples**: Clear scenarios for when to use the agent
5. **Color coding**: Follow established color patterns
6. **Proactive guidelines**: Specify if agent should be used proactively

### Agent Integration Best Practices
- **Favor orchestration over duplication**: Use existing specialized agents
- **Maintain clear boundaries**: Each agent should have distinct expertise
- **Document interdependencies**: Clear delegation and workflow patterns
- **Test agent interactions**: Ensure orchestrational workflows function correctly
