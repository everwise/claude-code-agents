## 🚀 Quick Reference

**Need to implement a Jira ticket end-to-end?**  
```> use jira-workitem-implementer for APL-1234```

**Need to review code or a PR?**  
```> use code-quality-reviewer to review this (block | file | PR)```

**Need to focus on fixing issues systematically?**  
```> use iterative-quality-fixer to identify and fix X```

**Need to plan out a new feature?**  
```> use feature-architect to plan implementation of Y feature```

**Need to resolve all PR feedback?**  
```> use pr-review-comment-resolver for PR #123```

**Need to debug errors or test failures?**  
```> use debugger to investigate and resolve X issue```

## 🛠️ Implementation & Features

### 🧭 [`feature-architect`](feature-architect.md) ⭐
**3-phase development: explore → plan → implement**
- Complex features, architectural changes, multi-component bugs
- *→ Chains: tdd-test-writer → debugger → code-quality-reviewer*

### 🎫 [`jira-workitem-implementer`](jira-workitem-implementer.md) ⭐
**Complete ticket automation: analysis → code → PR**
- Full development lifecycle from Jira ticket to merged PR
- *→ Chains: jira-workitem-analyzer → feature-architect → tdd-test-writer*

### 🧪 [`tdd-test-writer`](tdd-test-writer.md)
**Write tests before implementation**
- Test-driven development methodology
- Use at start of any development task

---

## 🐛 Bugs & Debugging

### 🚨 [`debugger`](debugger.md) 🔥
**Error resolution and troubleshooting**
- Activates automatically on any errors or test failures
- Specialized for investigating and resolving issues

### 🔄 [`iterative-quality-fixer`](iterative-quality-fixer.md) ⭐
**Systematic fix-test-verify cycles**
- Quality enforcement, automated improvement workflows  
- *→ Chains: debugger → code-quality-reviewer until passing*

---

## ✅ Code Review & Quality

### 👨‍💻 [`code-quality-reviewer`](code-quality-reviewer.md) 🔥
**Production-ready code analysis**
