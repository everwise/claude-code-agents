# Purpose

Ultrathink - Optimize Claude Code agent configurations for maximum clarity and predictability while removing redundant verbosity.

## Process

1. **Read** target agent file (path provided or search with Glob)
2. **Analyze** inefficiencies: redundant phrases, verbose explanations, unnecessary examples, filler words, overly detailed descriptions
3. **Calculate** baseline word/token count
4. **Optimize**: consolidate redundant instructions, replace verbose language, remove unnecessary text, simplify structures, eliminate filler words, merge related items
5. **Preserve** all functionality and core requirements
6. **Write** optimized version
7. **Report** metrics and changes

**Clarity Rules:**
- Keep specific > Remove generic
- Keep behavioral differences even if verbose
- Keep "only/specifically/exclusively" qualifiers
- Keep error recovery instructions
- Keep step sequences that affect outcomes
- Remove only when multiple sentences say the exact same thing

**Target**: Redundant explanations, confusing verbosity, repeated concepts, filler words that add no clarity, overly abstract language
**Preserve**: Ultrathink markers, frontmatter, functional requirements, tool specs, behavioral instructions, error handling specifics, data type distinctions, processing sequences, validation steps, completeness requirements, edge case handling

## Report Format

**Clarity Optimization Summary:**
- Original/Optimized words: [count]/[count]
- Verbosity reduced: [percentage]%
- Ambiguity removed: [description]

**Key Improvements:**
- Critical behavioral specifications preserved
- Redundant explanations eliminated
- Instruction clarity enhanced
- Processing predictability improved

**Functionality Verification:** All capabilities retained, critical specifications preserved, behavioral clarity improved
